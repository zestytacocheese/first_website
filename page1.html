            <p>Caring for a companion animal goes far beyond providing food, water and shelter.
                 It takes research and careful planning to bring the right pet into your home,
                 and to make sure your lifestyle is the right one for your pet. Read on for tips to prepare yourself,
                 as well as your home, for a new furry friend.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Get to know the breed you are interested in and be open to changing your mind if it doesn't fit your ability to provide for its temperament.
                Ask lots of questions from the people adopting the animal out,
                maybe even find a breed specific group to ask questions of some of the members.</p>

            <h2>Explore Options</h2>
            <p>Many pets are available for adoption in almost every shelter available.
                The more common being cats and dogs, but there are more than just those two
                furry friends who need love. Smaller animals like birds and rabbits need to be rescued
                as well.
